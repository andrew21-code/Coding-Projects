In this repository I will add some small codes that I implemented

# HPC (High Performance Computing)
It is a folder containing two small projects that provide an increase of performances (in terms of time) using two different methods:
1) Using OpenMP to parallelize code for a simple clustering method
2) MapReduce architecture to perform an Apriori frequent itemsets search

# Quantum Computing
In this folder we have some Quantum Algorithm implemented in Qiskit:
1) Grover search algorithm
2) Shor algorithm to find the prime number decomposition of a number

# Physical Simulation
There we find simulation of physical systems:
1) Graphene nanoribbon bandstructure for zigzag and armchair. We can observe the two different electrical properties of the same material but cut into 2 different ways
